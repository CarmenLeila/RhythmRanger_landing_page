# 💡 Introducing RhythmRanger

RhythmRanger is my end of the first year portfolio at Holberton School,at the Campus Lille France.It is a music application for all music's lovers in the world that is here to explore new musical horizons with every loved song.You can check on my landing page

In summary, RhythmRanger offers varied and personalized musical discoveries, helping users to explore different genders, artists and musical styles that they might not have found on their own.It uses advanced algorithms to recommend new songs that are from different places.

I set criteria for selection and analysis of liked songs and participate in user interface design to ensure a user-friendly experience.

I am thinking for more update and make this application better in the future.
